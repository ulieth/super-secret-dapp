# Love meets blockchain ❤️‍🔥🔗

Welcome to Super Secret, a privacy-conscious, decentralized dating app built with Anchor on the Solana blockchain. This DApp lets users create profiles, like each other, and receive small SOL rewards when mutual interests are formed — all powered by smart contracts.

🚧 This project is under construction and wrapped in layers of super secret magic. Expect surprises. Maybe even romance.
